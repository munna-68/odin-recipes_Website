<h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>
        <p>In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Add the chicken pieces and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Breading:</strong>
        <p>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fry the Chicken:</strong>
        <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or deep fryer to 350°F (175°C). Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and dredge them in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil and fry for 8-10 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the Sandwiches:</strong>
        <p>While the chicken is frying, toast the hamburger buns. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oil and drain on paper towels. Place a piece of fried chicken on each bun and top with your favorite toppings. Serve immediately.</p>
